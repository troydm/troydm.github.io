  <div class="entry-content"><p>TL;DR Writing your own Ruby DSL language to sync and manage your public and private dotfiles</p>

<p>As number of computers I own increased over the years and I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to get rid of some of the older ones so I thought that it was time to step down and think about management of dotfiles in more centralized, intuitive and automated way, because old ways of just <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> cloning weren&rsquo;t enough anymore.
Now there are systems that are actually tailored over that particular task such as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">GNU Stow</a> and <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io/">some other tools</a> however being a fairly lazy person I thought that writing my own would be a lot more easier and quicker than learning some tool that already existed.
The benefits of writing your own tools are that you don&rsquo;t have to learn them, they will do exactly what you want them to do and you could potentially design them as simple and straightforward as possible from the very start, not mentioning about learning some new technologies while doing something new. The requirements for this particular system were for it to be easily portable over Unix/Linux/BSD/MacOS systems, hassle-free to kick start and straightforward simple to use. I&rsquo;ve decided to develop <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a> targeting <strong>1.9.3</strong> version of <em>Ruby</em> language as most of the operating systems either provide that version or a newer version and because I&rsquo;ve already had experience developing <em>Ruby</em> based DSL to manage my ssh connections called <a href="https://github.com/troydm/sshc/">sshc</a> which proved to be very portable and easy to use.
Note that I&rsquo;ve also decided to not support Windows operating system as there isn&rsquo;t much benefit or need of doing that as I don&rsquo;t use it or know anyone who would want some dotfiles management system for it.
The result of this endeavor is in my git repo called <a href="https://github.com/troydm/dotcentral/">dotcentral</a> however for learning experience I&rsquo;m going to recreate it step by step for this blog post.
Also note that this repo contains my own dotfiles too alongside <em>Ruby</em> DSL configuration files used to automatically install them. So let&rsquo;s get started from scratch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TL;DR Writing parser combinator library in Clojure from scratch</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve had an fortunate opportunity to participate in a commercial project that was heavy on parsing and I&rsquo;ve decided to use <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> as my main tool for doing it.
As you might all know <strong>Clojure</strong> is not new to the game and is quite mature functional programming language with a hidden power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">Lisp</a>. One of the distinct features of <strong>Clojure</strong> which I personally adore is nrepl and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_programming">Interactive Programming</a> incremental development style which it cultivates. This is by no means something new, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common Lisp</a> has it via <em>slime/swank</em>, some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a> implementations have <em>geiser</em> support and almost all Smalltalk variants could be considered as full interactive programming environments, one notable example being <a href="http://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>.
There are some more specialized interactive programming environments like <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> and <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a> which deal with either sound or visual or even both but today we&rsquo;ll be talking about parsing and all things related instead.
Before I&rsquo;ll start explaining what we are actually trying to build I would like to introduce you to a really nice open source library that I&rsquo;ve successfully used in a commercial project I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, called <a href="https://github.com/blancas/kern">kern</a>. But as all things good there is always some value in trying to build your own even better, at least for me it was an insightful journey. So yeah as title says we&rsquo;ll be building parser combinator library in <strong>Clojure</strong> just to learn a thing or two but solely just for fun. The full source for impatient ones is in my <a href="https://github.com/troydm/ccp/">ccp</a> repo.
So let&rsquo;s get started then.</p>

<p><a href="http://troydm.github.io/blog/2015/08/03/lifting-shadows-off-a-memory-allocation/">Previously</a> we&rsquo;ve talked about manual memory allocation and unraveled some shadows around it.
Now let&rsquo;s talk about automatic memory allocation, more specifically about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29">Garbage Collection</a>.
Most if not all modern Programming Languages contain a mechanism that handles allocation of memory automatically at precisely the moment application needs it and deallocation of that
memory at the moment it&rsquo;s not needed anymore. However determining when memory region (or object) is safe to deallocate is not an easy feat as we need to somehow determine if the region is needed or not.
And here is where <em>Garbage Collection</em> comes into a play. Simply speaking <em>Garbage Collection</em> is an algorithm that checks entire memory of an application for regions that aren&rsquo;t referenced anywhere inside application by other memory regions and deallocates these regions because they aren&rsquo;t needed anymore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TL;DR <em>Writing power-of-2 malloc memory allocator in C</em></p>

<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic or so they say. Today we are going to lift some shadows from
the very basic thing that is dynamic memory management in an application process. This knowledge is essential for anyone who wants to write his/her own <em>Programming Language</em> so gaining this knowledge is not an optional thing since it opens a whole new lever of understanding how dynamic memory is managed by application and is split between different applications. To do that we need to have some basic understanding of how the actual physical thing is used by operating system. For those who don&rsquo;t know anything about <em>Virtual Memory</em> or what <em>Memory Pages</em> are and which algorithms modern operating systems are using to manage those I suggest reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/1118063333/">Operating Systems Concepts</a> and for those who want to know all the guts of how <em>Linux</em> does this under the hood there is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Linux-Kernel-Third-Daniel/dp/0596005652/">Understanding Linux Kernel</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TL;DR <em>Writing functional programming library in Java</em></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional Programming</a> paradigm and languages that fully utilize it&rsquo;s benefits are slowly gaining popularity nowadays not only in academia but also in enterprise becoming de facto standard for future generations of programmers. Maybe in 10 years from now humanity will come up with a better idea of how to make bug-free quality software that does the job and takes less effort to produce, however currently we are living in a century of <em>Object Oriented</em> programming systems slowly morphing into <em>Functional Programming</em> systems. There are a lot of learning resources on internet about <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-resources-for-learning-about-functional-programming-Why">Function Programming</a> in general and Functional Languages such as <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and many other. You all probably heard about <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn you a Haskell for Great Good</a> book, a really bright, colorful and interesting book that got me into Haskell programming few years ago. Some of you may even tried reading it. I think most of people without prior functional programming experience that start reading it sooner or later hit a bottom of their mental capacity while trying to comprehend <em>Monads</em>. This article is intended for this people! Yes this post is all about <em>Functors</em> and <em>Monads</em> you heard it right! In order to explore the ideas of functional programming let&rsquo;s create a small functional programming library in <strong>Java</strong> that will have <em>Functors</em> and <em>Monads</em> and by doing so learn about functional programming from a really unusual perspective of using Object Oriented programming. Our target compiler will be <strong>Java 6</strong> (yes we won&rsquo;t be using new fancy <strong>Java 8</strong>) as most of the people that are reading this now are probably more familiar with it rather than newer version. For those of you who are too lazy to follow can check the whole thing at my <a href="https://github.com/troydm/fpj">fpj</a> repository, however I strongly encourage you to try reimplement it all by yourself from scratch. The information described in this post implies that you have prior experience or basic understand of <em>Monads</em> but want to better understand them internally. So let&rsquo;s get to work!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TL;DR <em>Rewriting micro compiler in OCaml</em></p>

<p>In <a href="http://troydm.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/writing-micro-compiler-in-ocaml/">my previous post</a> I&rsquo;ve talked about writing micro compiler in OCaml under 300 lines of source code. There are number of ways to make our work easier and number of source code lines significantly smaller.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2q3i5KA.gif" alt="Potato Loli" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s rewrite our micro compiler using tools called <em>lexer</em> and <em>parser</em> generators. We&rsquo;ll be using tools called <strong>ocamllex</strong> and <strong>ocamlyacc</strong> which are distributed with <em>OCaml</em> compiler and are modeled after
famous <strong>lex</strong> and <strong>yacc</strong> tools for <em>Unix</em> operating systems. Those tools actually have better modern analogues called <strong>flex</strong> and <strong>bison</strong> which are described in detail in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/flex-bison-Text-Processing-Tools/dp/0596155972/">Flex &amp; Bison: Text Processing Tools</a> book.
Nowadays however if you are writing a professional compiler in <em>OCaml</em> I strongly suggest you consider using <a href="https://github.com/alainfrisch/sedlex">sedlex</a> and <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/">menhir</a> instead of <strong>ocamllex</strong> and <strong>ocamlyacc</strong> as both tools are quite outdated and
lack some significant features that their modern analogues have such as unicode support for lexing, parameterized parser generation and built-in grammar interpreter. So what are lexer and parser generators?
To put it simply <strong>ocamllex</strong> and <strong>ocamlyacc</strong> take special <em>.mll</em> and <em>.mly</em> definition files of lexer and parser semantics mixed with <em>OCaml</em> source code and generate an <em>.ml</em> source code files that do the actual token generation and parsing for you.
Pretty neat indeed, and it&rsquo;s actually easier to use than it sounds so let&rsquo;s rewrite our micro compiler using those tools. We&rsquo;ll be using original source code of micro compiler as reference only as entire code base needs to be changed. You can see the end result of our rewrite in <a href="https://github.com/troydm/micro/tree/simple">micro</a> git repository branch called <em>simple</em>. For the actual description of the micro language see my previous post. So let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TL;DR <em>Writing micro compiler in OCaml</em></p>

<p>At one point or another every single software developer in the world comes to a realization in his career when the time is ripe and it&rsquo;s time
to write your own super cool programming language.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KSiXBCN.png" alt="Lemon Loli" /></p>

<p>However the subject of creating your own programming language with an compiler is quite a complex one and can&rsquo;t be tackled without some pre-research.
That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Compiler-Charles-N-Fischer/dp/0805321667/">Crafting Compiler in C</a>, an aged but
really comprehensive book about developing your own compiler for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_%28programming_language%29">Ada</a>-like programming language.
Second chapter describes writing a really simple micro language targeting pseudo assembly-like output in order to explain the core concepts of developing your
own compiler and writing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser">LL(1)</a> parser.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try rewriting this micro compiler in <a href="http://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, a language better suited for writing compilers that is becoming quite popular due to it&rsquo;s clean syntax and strict evaluation semantics combined
with functional and object-oriented programming styles. If you are not familiar with OCaml try reading <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">Real World OCaml</a> first.
Instead of outputting pseudo assembly our micro compiler will output a real <a href="http://www.nasm.us/">nasm</a> source code which will be automatically compiled into a binary executable file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TL;DR <em>Fixing some really old Prolog implementation written in Pascal</em></p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">Logic Programming</a>, notably in learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>
so I&rsquo;m in a process of reading two great books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prolog-Programming-Artificial-Intelligence-Bratko/dp/0201403757/">Programming for Artificial Intelligence</a> and
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Prolog-Programming-Techniques/dp/0262192500/">The Art of Prolog</a>. If you want to get a quick feel of <em>Prolog</em> I recommend you take a look at
Bernardo Pires&rsquo;s <a href="https://bernardopires.com/2013/10/try-logic-programming-a-gentle-introduction-to-prolog/">Gentle Introduction to Prolog</a> and <a href="http://prologomenon.wordpress.com/">Prologomenon</a> blog.
To put it simply <em>Prolog</em> is all about logic, deduction and backtracking</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Mwlmvyk.jpg" alt="Sherlock Loli" /></p>

<p>While browsing <a href="http://reddit.com/r/prolog">/r/prolog</a> I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/prologforprogrammers/">Prolog for Programmers</a> originally published in 1985, an old book indeed
and honestly sometimes hard to follow. I can&rsquo;t recommend it as a starter book about <em>Prolog</em> but it&rsquo;s still quite interesting to read. However it has a whole two chapters describing implementation of
<em>Prolog</em> interpreter which is quite a complex task and sparkled my interest in continuing reading this book. Authors provide source code of two version of Prolog interpreter,
the one they originally wrote in <em>Pascal</em> back in 1983 and it&rsquo;s port to <em>C</em> in 2013 which, as stated on their website, was done because they couldn&rsquo;t compile old <em>Pascal</em> code
with <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/">Free Pascal Compiler</a> and because&hellip; well <em>Pascal</em> is quite out of fashion nowadays. Couldn&rsquo;t compile?! Well, challenge accepted!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TL;DR <em>Writing data collecter, processor and broadcaster in Scheme</em></p>

<p>Any software developer who worked in financial industry will tell you that there are
few key requirements to programming applications for real time market. Applications should be as fast as possible and
they should be as easily modifiable as possible. First requirement is essential since getting and processing information
takes time and sending processed information takes even additional precious time, and in financial world time equals money.
Second requirement is determined by constantly changing business rules imposed on data processing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TL;DR <em>Writing IRC bot in Perl</em></p>

<p>Some people use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> to chat, some don&rsquo;t.
It was invented a really long time ago and isn&rsquo;t going away anytime soon despite some new generation alternatives popping up like <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>.</p>

<p>Personally I always have my IRC client running (I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://weechat.org/">weechat</a> + <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>) and chat with lots of interesting people
who inspire me to try new technologies and learn something different every day. One person, who&rsquo;s nickname I won&rsquo;t name, was always telling me about how awesome <a href="http://perl.org/" title="Perl">Perl</a>
as a programming language is and how great it&rsquo;s potential is thanks to <a href="http://cpan.org" title="CPAN">CPAN</a> that has almost 124k modules for any life situation.
I always thought he was exaggerating and literally acting like a <a href="http://perl.org/" title="Perl">Perl</a> fanboy. <a href="http://perl.org/" title="Perl">Perl</a> was the first programming language I&rsquo;ve learned back in the late 90&rsquo;s
and remembering how frustrating my experience with it was and how cryptic it really was for me do something with it when I was unexperienced and lacked lots of qualities that make up a
any decent software engineer I was skeptic about using it again.
Well, time passed, time always passes, and I haven&rsquo;t written anything more than quick 50 line server scripts in <a href="http://perl.org/" title="Perl">Perl</a> for almost 13 years.
I&rsquo;ve almost forgotten everything about <a href="http://perl.org/" title="Perl">Perl</a>. Since lately I was having this crazy idea about writing IRC bot that could store and execute shell scripts on server
so I could automate my servers through IRC, I thought why not write it in <a href="http://perl.org/" title="Perl">Perl</a>. I&rsquo;ve remembered that person who was always bragging about <a href="http://perl.org/" title="Perl">Perl</a>&rsquo;s greatness wrote an IRC bot in <a href="http://perl.org/" title="Perl">Perl</a>
using <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/POE::Component::IRC" title="POCO::IRC">POE::Component::IRC</a> so I&rsquo;ve decided to try and use the same framework for my bot. It&rsquo;s based on really popular <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/POE" title="POE">POE</a> event loop framework which is very easy to learn and use.
<strong>Matt Cashner</strong> wrote a really good introduction article called <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2004/07/02/poeintro.html">Application Design with POE</a></p>
